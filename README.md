# QuickScope

![QuickScope Logo](readme-assets/app-icon.png)

QuickScope is a macOS app that extends Quick Look functionality to folders. When you press the spacebar on a folder in Finder, instead of just seeing the folder icon, you'll get a preview showing the folder's contents - just like how Quick Look works for files.


### With QuickScope, folder previews look like this:

### And with QuickScope installed, they look like this:

## How It Works

QuickScope consists of two components:

1. **Main App** (`QuickScope.app`): A minimal macOS application that hosts the Quick Look extension
2. **Quick Look Extension** (`QuickScopeQL.appex`): The extension that generates folder previews

When you install and run the app, it registers a Quick Look extension with the system. This extension handles the `public.folder` content type, allowing macOS to use QuickScope for folder previews.
